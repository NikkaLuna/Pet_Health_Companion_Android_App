# Pet Health Companion Mobile Application

## Overview

The Pet Health Companion is a minimum viable product (MVP) created in Android Studio, an Android app development environment. 

This application is designed to address pet owners' needs for managing their pet health, primarily focusing on scheduling pet health care appointments. 

The intuitive interface offers pet owners the ability to add, edit, and delete upcoming appointments, ensuring their furry friends receive timely care.

## Development Environment

- **Android Studio**: The main Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to create Android apps, providing tools for coding and debugging.
- **Android SDK**: The Android Software Development Kit (SDK) is used for creating, testing, and distributing Android applications.
- **Room Persistence Library**: A component of Android Jetpack, Room is a library for managing SQLite databases, acting as an abstraction layer over underlying database infrastructures.
- **Version Control**: Git is used for tracking changes in source code, enabling team collaboration and efficient code management.
- **Dependency Management**: Gradle is used to manage dependencies and construct Android projects, making it easy to add external modules and libraries.

- **Customized Notifications**: Users can set notifications for upcoming appointments, ensuring they never miss a vet visit.

## Security

The application ensures that user data always remains secure, providing a seamless experience for pet owners to manage their pets' healthcare activities.

## Unit Testing

The unit test process ensures that the application's codebase is reliable and robust. The plan uses a custom methodology to test specified parts of the application. Core functions such as adding and deleting pets and appointments are assessed to ensure their reliability and accuracy. These tests are valuable for checking the functionality of core features both in isolation and when integrated as a whole.

- **Addition and Deletion of Pet**: The unit tests involve the submission of simulated input data (mock pet) to thoroughly assess and validate the application's mechanism for properly storing and removing data.
- **Addition and Deletion of Appointment**: The unit tests utilize a mock appointment to test how the data process behaves, evaluating the precision of data persistence and elimination from the database.

## Deliverables

- **Test Scripts**: The source code includes a set of test scripts written using the JUnit testing framework, JUnit assertion library, and Mockito for integration testing.
- **Test Results**: A report provides an overview of the test outcomes, encompassing successful tests and, if present, any failures, accompanied by error messages.
