*Users can enter a pet's name to retrieve a detailed, timestamped report of past and upcoming appointments.*

## Security

- To safeguard the confidentiality of pet data, the application implements a secure authentication system utilizing industry-standard hashing algorithms.
- Users are required to log in with secure credentials, which are then hashed and stored using robust encryption techniques.  This prevents plaintext password storage.

## Unit Testing

**Pet & Appointment Management**:

  - **Addition and Deletion**: Simulates adding and deleting pets to validate data storage and removal mechanisms.
  - **Addition and Deletion**: Use mock appointments to evaluate data persistence and removal.
      
**Testing Framework**:
  - **JUnit and Mockito**: Employed for test script creation and integration testing to ensure overall functionality.
    
**Deliverables**:
  - **Test Scripts**: Written using JUnit and Mockito for automated verification.
  - **Test Results Report**: Detailed report of test outcomes, including successes, failures, and error messages.

## Challenge

During the initial development phase, the project packages in Android Studio were named 'demo', which violated the Google Play Console's package naming guidelines. Attempting to refactor all files within their respective packages using Android Studio proved challenging, as it disrupted the project's configurations and dependencies.

To address this issue, I took the following approach:

- **New Project Directory**: I created a new project directory with a compliant package name, adhering to the Google Play Console's naming conventions.
- **Clean Setup**: Within the new directory, I rebuilt the project from scratch, ensuring that all configurations and dependencies were correctly set up from the start.
- **Code Migration**: I carefully migrated the existing codebase to the new project, maintaining the project's structure and functionality.
- **Testing and Validation**: I conducted thorough testing and validation to ensure that the migrated project functioned as expected, without any regressions or issues.

By following this approach, I successfully resolved the package naming issue and ensured compliance with the Google Play Console's guidelines.
